# A place to be obscure
<br>
Where there are simple rules.
<br>
1. Everything should be readable for humans and machines.
2. Everything should be accessible to low-end computers.
3. Site should have no code dependencies.
4. Everything should be static and offline-first.
5. No JS should be used unless it benefits navigation of the site.
<br>
<br>
## Roadmap
<br>
This is the very beginning of this project. So, I'll trace a map of what's to expect of it.
<br>
1. Get a functional static site generator written in Ansi C with no dependencies.
<br>
2. Start writting.
<br>
<br>
## Static site generator
<br>
This will be very simple. I will create my own MD parser that reads files and organizes them based on their folder location.
<br>
I will have a very basic sidebar template with html that will serve only for navigation. There will be a place holder which will be replaced with the generated HTML from each MD file.
<br>
<br>
### Images and visual content
<br>
I will be adding screenshots and diagrams for the most part. I'll have to find a way to create diagrams from this computer. I'm thinking about creating a pixel-art drawing program using Raylib and C. It would have basic tools such as lines, rectangles, circles, and text. It would use a fixed color palette to keep things simple. And it would use the same font within the site to keep visuals consistent.
