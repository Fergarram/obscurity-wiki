# A place to be obscure

This is a personal wiki. It's inspired by [Devine's personal wiki](wiki.xxiivv.com/site/about.html). My intention for this wiki is to have a minimal and obscure place to record my knowledge about computers, hardware, linux, Ansi C, Raspberry Pi, etc.

It's also a place where I want to keep notes and thoughts about implementing an artificial mind. I believe that we don't need an overly complicated solution, and I don't believe we need tons of computational power to be able to create an artificial mind that can communicate with us through text messages. Having said this, it will not be easy to implement it. This is just an attempt and I can be completely wrong about everything I say. I have been *possesed* with thoughts of how to implement such a project for quite a few years now. At this point, I just need to get this through and out of my system.

## Site Rules

Here are a few rules to keep things tidy.

1. Everything should be readable for humans and [machines](/everything-needs-an-api).
2. Everything should be accessible from low-end computers.
3. Site should have no third-party code dependencies.
4. Everything should be static and offline-first.
5. No JS should be used unless it benefits navigation of the site.


### Images and visual content

I will be adding screenshots and diagrams for the most part. I'll have to find a way to create diagrams from this computer. I'm thinking about creating a pixel-art drawing program using Raylib and C. It would have basic tools such as lines, rectangles, circles, and text. It would use a fixed color palette to keep things simple. And it would use the same font within the site to keep visuals consistent.
